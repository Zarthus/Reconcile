Frostbite - contributing
========================

Should you be willing to contribute to any module, or make your own - it should meet the following guidelines:  

Tested thoroughly,  
Non exploiting - as in that it does not try attempt malicious activities, or otherwise goes against guidelines of tools (such as websites) it is interacting with,  
flake8 ([PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [Pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes)) compatible,  
Your code is not longer than 119 characters (raised from the original 79 pep8 checks against)  
Travis compatible (see [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) to see what tests are being performed)  
[RFC 1459 compatible](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html)  
Should your module require an API key, please edit `config.example.json` and `docs/apikeys.md` accordingly.  
Should your module require a configuration block, don't forget to edit the [wiki](https://github.com/Zarthus/Frostbite/wiki/Configuring-Frostbite)
