{"name":"Reconcile","tagline":"Reconcile is a Python Utility IRC bot for python3 and higher.","body":"Reconcile \r\n=========\r\n\r\nA Python Utility bot for python3 and above.\r\n\r\n### In development\r\n\r\nAs of right now, Reconcile is under development and not yet ready for actual use.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo make use of Reconcile, ensure the following requirements are met:  \r\n\r\n* Running an installation of Windows or Linux (Windows 7, Debian, and Ubuntu are tested)  \r\n* Python 3 or higher is installed (http://python.org)  \r\n* A working internet connection.  \r\n* You have downloaded the requirements with pip or apt-get (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) \r\n* The network you wish to run this on uses Atheme services. It may not work on other services. \r\n\r\n### Configuring your bot.\r\n\r\nOnce the installation requirements are satified, copy or rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and configure it to your liking.  \r\n\r\nHere is a copy of a configuration with comments -- but do not copy it directly, use `config.example.json` for that.   \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"irc\": { // irc block\r\n    \"espernet\": { // name of the block.\r\n      \"server\": \"irc.esper.net\", // server to connect to.\r\n      \"port\": 6667, // port to connect to - do not use a plus sign.\r\n\t  \"ssl\": false, // connecting with ssl or not \r\n\r\n      \"nick\": \"Reconcile\", // the primary nickname to try. \r\n      \"altnick\": \"Reconcile_\", // if the primary nickname is taken, we connect with this instead. Leave blank for nick_\r\n\r\n\t  \"ident\": \"reconcile\", // the ident (also known as username) of the bot \r\n      \"realname\": \"Zarthus his bot\", // the real name of the bot, if left blank it will contain a link to the github repository\r\n\r\n      \"account\": \"zarthus-bots\", // the account to identify to.\r\n      \"password\": \"irc-password\", // the password the bot should use to identify to the account specified.\r\n\r\n      \"command_prefix\": \"!\", // The prefix all commands will have.\r\n\r\n      // A list of administrators, supports wildcard *, nickname (anything before !) can be left out.\r\n      // administrators have access to everything, use this with caution.\r\n\t  \"administrators\": [\r\n        \"Zarthus!Zarthus@zarth.us\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \r\n\t  \"moderators\": [\r\n        \"hej@hello.me\",\r\n        \"bye@goodbye.net\",\r\n        \"*@moderate.us\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  // a list of api keys some modules require, modules will automatically unload themselves if no api key was found.\r\n  // and will be found in disabled_modules/no_api_key/\r\n  \"api_keys\": {\r\n    \"lastfm\": \"\",\r\n\t\"wolframalpha\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  \r\n  // bot metadata, generally data that is used in certain modules.\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"bot_version\": \"0.1\", // the bot version\r\n    \"bot_maintainer\": \"Zarthus\", // the bot maintainer, change this to your own name\r\n    \"github_url\": \"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/zarthus\\/reconcile\", // a link to the github repository where the source code can be found\r\n    \"verbose\": true // verbosity; some things will not be logged if this is set to false. Can be useful for debugging.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce these requirements are met, go ahead and run `python bot.py` to start the bot.\r\n\r\n### Disabling (or enabling) a module\r\n\r\nModules are automatically loaded if they are in the `modules/` folder, therefore any modules you do not wish to load should be moved to `disabled_modules/`, and vice versa.  \r\n\r\n## Contributing  \r\n\r\nShould you be willing to contribute to any module, or make your own - it should meet the following guidelines:  \r\nTested thoroughly,  \r\nNon exploiting - as in that it does not try attempt malicious activies, or otherwise goes against guidelines of tools (such as websites) it is interacting with,  \r\nPEP8 compatible,  \r\nYour code is not longer than 119 characters (raised from the original 79 pep8 checks against)  \r\nTravis compatible (see `.travis.yml` to see what tests are being performed) \r\n\r\n### Bugs / Suggestions\r\nFeel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/zarthus/reconcile/issues/new) if you think you've found a bug, or have a suggestion.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nShould you have issues getting the bot running, have an issue, or have a general inquiry, you can contact me on IRC via [webchat](https://webchat.esper.net/?channels=zarthus) or [connect directly with a client](irc://irc.esper.net/zarthus)  \r\n\r\nIt may take a while to get a response; and I do not guarantee one, as I am not a 24/7 answering machine. But I'll try my best!\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-52901542-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
