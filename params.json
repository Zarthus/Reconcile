{"name":"Reconcile","tagline":"Reconcile is a Python Utility IRC bot for python3 and higher.","body":"Reconcile [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zarthus/Reconcile.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Zarthus/Reconcile)\r\n=========\r\n\r\nA Python Utility bot for python3 and above.  \r\nCompatible with RFC1459 networks such as networks that run charybdis, ircd-seven or ircd-ratbox.  \r\nThis bot was designed with Atheme services in mind, and may not work optimally on networks that run different services.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo make use of Reconcile, ensure the following requirements are met:  \r\n\r\n* Running an installation of Windows or Linux (Windows 7, Debian, and Ubuntu are tested)  \r\n* Python 3 or higher is installed (http://python.org)  \r\n* A working internet connection.  \r\n* You have downloaded the requirements with pip or apt-get (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) \r\n* The network you wish to run this on uses Atheme services. It may not work on other services. \r\n\r\n### Configuring your bot.\r\n\r\nOnce the installation requirements are satified, copy or rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and configure it to your liking.  \r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/Zarthus/Reconcile/wiki/Configuring-Reconcile) is a copy of a configuration with comments -- describing what they do and which options are available.  \r\nBut do not copy it directly, use `config.example.json` for that.  \r\n\r\nOnce these requirements are met, go ahead and run `python bot.py` to start the bot.\r\n\r\n### Disabling (or enabling) a module\r\n\r\nModules are automatically loaded if they are in the `modules/` folder, therefore any modules you do not wish to load should be moved to `disabled_modules/`, and vice versa.  \r\n\r\n## Contributing  \r\n\r\nShould you be willing to contribute to any module, or make your own - it should meet the following guidelines:  \r\n\r\nTested thoroughly,  \r\nNon exploiting - as in that it does not try attempt malicious activities, or otherwise goes against guidelines of tools (such as websites) it is interacting with,  \r\nflake8 ([PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [Pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes)) compatible,  \r\nYour code is not longer than 119 characters (raised from the original 79 pep8 checks against)  \r\nTravis compatible (see [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) to see what tests are being performed)  \r\n[RFC 1459 compatible](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html)\r\nShould your module require an API key, please edit `config.example.json` and `docs/apikeys.md` accordingly.  \r\nShould your module require a configuration block, don't forget to edit the [wiki](https://github.com/Zarthus/Reconcile/wiki/Configuring-Reconcile)\r\n\r\n### Bugs / Suggestions\r\nFeel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/zarthus/reconcile/issues/new) if you think you've found a bug, or have a suggestion.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nShould you have issues getting the bot running, have an issue, or have a general inquiry, you can contact me on IRC via [webchat](https://webchat.esper.net/?channels=zarthus) or [connect directly with a client](irc://irc.esper.net/zarthus)  \r\n\r\nIt may take a while to get a response; and I do not guarantee one, as I am not a 24/7 answering machine. But I'll try my best!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
